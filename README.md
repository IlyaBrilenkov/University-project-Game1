There are two main types of enemies - ground enemies and flying enemies. Ground enemies move in fixed range, but can detect the character and start moving towards the character changing the range. Ground enemies also strike ice balls in the direction of the character, if the character is in the detection range. Ground enemies can detect the character only when moving towards the character and when the character is on the ground (not jumping). So, it’s much easier to jump over the ground enemy when it moves away from the character. If an enemy is near a canyon or near a collectable item, it might be useful to attract the enemy’s attention to change its range.  

The flying enemies just fly from right to left and randomly strike ice or fire balls. There are two kinds of flying enemies - ice and fire. Each type strikes corresponding balls. 

The ice balls freeze the character when touched, dividing the character speed by the ice power (it’s various depending on the level), the speed will recover. When the character is under freezing, there is light blue stroke around the character. The fire balls just kill the character.

There are two levels. In the first level there are only ground enemies. In the second level there are both types of enemies, ice power also increases a little bit.

There are day and night modes. The sun falls down the horisont and the night begins. It’s just a visual effect. I also added music. One composition is looped from the beginning of the game  and another composition is for the moment when players win the game.

Hope it will be interesting to play.
